            <h2>About me</h2>
            <img id="img1" src="images/photo.png" alt="Description of image 1">
            <p>I am originally from Mexico, where I pursued a degree in Business Administration as my first academic
                endeavor. However, my deep passion for technology ignited a desire for a second career in web
                development.
                The Pathway program has opened an incredible door for me, allowing me to step onto this exciting new
                career path. This path not only promises improved job prospects but also provides the flexibility to
                work
                from the comfort of my home.</p>
            <h2>Mexico</h2>
            <img id="img2" src="images/bandera.jpg" alt="Description of image 2">
            <p>It is the eleventh most populous country in the world, with a population of approximately 118 million
                inhabitants. The mother tongue is Spanish, which coexists with 67 indigenous languages. Mexico is a
                representative and democratic republic, made up of free states, united by a federal pact.</p>
